Script Project_1B.ipynb is self explanatory. Comments are there for most of the scripts.

Here is the flow:

1. Read the generated csv file into music_library.
2. Based on the query1, create a new table music_app_library with appropriate Primary Key Cluster, load the data and validate the results.
3. Based on the query2, create a new table user_sessoin with appropriate Primary Key Cluster, load the data and validate the results.
4. Based on the query3, create a new table user_songs with appropriate Primary Key Cluster, load the data and validate the results.
5. Drop the tables and close the connection.
